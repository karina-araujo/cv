        <h1> Karina Araujo </h1>
        <p><em>Bachelor in Tourism</em></p>
        <p>A Tourism industry professional with 14 years of experience dealing with suppliers across domestic and international markets, tourism boards, travel agents and passengers. Skilled in Account and Product Management, Sales and Business
          Development, Marketing, Negotiation, Operations, Customer Care and Commercial Relationships.

          My business experiences provided me a good knowledge of the British and European Tourism and also of the Brazilian market. Since I graduated in Tourism I have been working in the Tourism trade, initially based in Brazil and currently in
          London.

          I am hard worker, well-organized and a very positive and responsible person. I enjoy new challenges, to be in contact with different cultures and love dealing with the travel trade.
          I am fluent in English and Portuguese and I can speak very good Spanish and Italian.

          At the moment, as a parallel project, I am dedicating myself to study Front-End Web Development.
